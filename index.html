                <h2>What do I need to do?</h2>

                <p>
                    Follow the directions on top of the method panel and tell the app what kind of pulse you observe
                    there by clicking the appropriate button.
                    It will then advance to the next stage and tell you where to go next.
                    Repeat this until you have located the spot or the app tells you which spot you need to dig at.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span><img src="assets/icons/info.png" class="inline-img"></span> These methods assume that you have
                    a meerkats
                    familiar active to boost your scan range by 5 tiles.
                    If you don't use meerkats, <b>the method will not work and you will get angry.</b> Use meerkats.
                </p>

                <h2>What are pings/pulses and how do they work?</h2>

                <p>
                    For scan clues, at any given tile the speed of pulses around your character give you information
                    about which dig spots still need to be considered.
                    It will tell you if the spot you are looking for is within the scan range (triple pulse),
                    within two times the scan range (double pulse) or beyond two times the scan range (single pulse).
                    Different pulse types can be distinguished by look and by sound.
                    See the video below for details.
                </p>

                <h2>How/Why do the methods work?</h2>

                <p>
                    The method shown here uses the information gained at any given step to narrow down the dig spots
                    you still need to consider.
                    The described paths are carefully crafted to allow both quickly identifying the dig spot and quickly
                    moving between spots by considering surge/dive pathing.
                    The paths are a tree datastructure and for the most part match a <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search_tree">ternary search tree</a>.
                </p>

                <h2> What is "Different level" about?</h2>

                <p>
                    Sometimes, a scan clue tells you to try scanning a different level.
                    This can be used to immediately rule out a large portion of dig spots without actually having to go
                    there, and is therefore incorporated into the scan routes where possible.
                    Like always, follow the directions of the method and tell the app if the clue tells you to scan a
                    different level when you get there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For Dorgesh-Kaan and Brimhaven dungeon, this information tells you whether the dig spot is on the
                    upper or lower floor.
                    For Taverley dungeon and the Fremmenik Slayer Dungeon, for some spots the clue also says to scan a
                    different level when standing outside the dungeon and the dig spot is at a certain spot.
                    This rules out spots before even entering the scan area.
                </p>

                    <h2>Version b0.3.1 - 2023-06-17</h2>

                    <p>This is a minor patch to get some small changes released while working on larger features that will take some time to finish.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The marker icon overlaying scan areas to center the scan radius around has been removed to reduce clutter.</li>
                        <li>You can now click the pulse types in the scan view to advance two steps at once.</li>
                        <li>A tile grid overlay has been added to the map to make it easier to identify the correct tiles.</li>
                        <li>A bunch of teleports on the map have been added/slightly repositioned or had their icons updated.</li>
                        <li>The scan editor now explains what to do when interacting with the map.</li>

                <div class="patchnotesection" data-patchnotes="b0.3">
                    <h2>Version b0.3 - 2023-06-12</h2>

                    <p>
                        b0.3 focuses on internal improvements, more colorful instructions and an editor for scan routes.
                        It also comes with new and improved scan routes.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The scan editor is now publicly available.
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                        Only available in the browser. Check it out by selecting any scan and clicking
                                        the edit button in the top right corner of the map.
                                        There is no manual for it yet, feel free to reach out with questions.

                                        Please note that created scan routes can not be locally saved and used yet, the
                                        ability to do so will most likely be included in b0.4
                                        In the meantime, you can save them manually by exporting and later importing
                                        them.

                        <li>The zoom when advancing to the next step has been tweaked to reliably include all the
                            necessary spots.

                        <li>The scan radius around key areas is now displayed.</li>

                        <li>The map can now have its floor changed. Selected clues automatically change to the correct
                            floor.

                                    One Example: Scan routes are now automatically verified and can essentially never be
                                    wrong.
                                    They can still be bad, but the remaining candidates will always be correct and no
                                    spots can be forgotten.
                                    This includes all of the "different level" logic.
